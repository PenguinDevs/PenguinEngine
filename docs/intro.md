# Getting started with PenguinEngine

Here are some quick links to get started with PenguinEngine:

* [Installation guide](/docs/install)
* [API docs](/api/AccelTween)

PenguinEngine is a module script loader largely inspired by [Quenty's Nevermore Engine](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine), and is designed to be compatible with it. This monorepo of packages is merely an extension of Nevermore, and is not a replacement. Although, it can still be installed and used standalone from Nevermore.
